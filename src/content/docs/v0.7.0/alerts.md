title: Alerts
version: v0.7.0
order: 45
summary: Deduped state-machined alerts page distinct from the per-event audit log. Alert rules per source decide what auto-promotes to a ticket. Dashboard widget surfaces top firing alerts.
since: v0.7.0

## Two tables, one purpose

| Table | Role |
|---|---|
| `external_alert_event` | Immutable audit log. One row per webhook fire / poll match. Never updated. |
| `alerts` | Deduped state-machined record. One row per `(source_id, external_event_id)` pair. Transitions `firing` → `recovered` as the vendor fires + clears. |

A noisy alert that flaps 17 times in an hour writes 17 audit rows but lives as a single `alerts` row with `refire_count = 17` and a refreshed `last_seen_at`. The Alerts page reads from `alerts`; the audit trail is available on the alert detail panel for forensics.

---

## Lifecycle

1. Webhook fire / API poll match lands in `services/alertIngest.js`.
2. The shared pipeline writes one `external_alert_event` row (audit) + upserts the `alerts` row (`first_seen_at` set on insert, `last_seen_at` always refreshed, `refire_count` incremented on update).
3. The alert evaluator (`services/alertEvaluator.js`) runs through the source's `alert_rules` in priority order:
   - `severity_min` — minimum vendor severity to consider.
   - `title_regex` — optional title match.
   - `action` — `promote_ticket` / `notify_only` / `ignore`.
4. First matching rule wins. `promote_ticket` creates a ticket via the same path as the legacy webhook → ticket flow, attaches the alert id, and stamps `alerts.ticket_id` + `alerts.promoted_at` + `alerts.promoted_by_rule_id`.
5. When the vendor fires a recovery event with the same `external_event_id`, the alert flips to `state='recovered'`, `recovered_at` is stamped. If the source has `auto_resolve_on_recovery=TRUE` and the alert has a linked ticket, the ticket auto-resolves.

## Alert rules

Configured at **Admin → Alert sources → {source} → Alert rules**.

```
INSERT INTO alert_rules (
  source_id, name, severity_min,
  title_regex, action, priority_order
) VALUES (
  42, 'Promote High+ for production', 2,
  '(?i)\\b(prod|production)\\b', 'promote_ticket', 10
);
```

Rules evaluate in `priority_order ASC`. First match wins. Without any matching rule, the default action is `notify_only` — the alert sits on the Alerts page + dashboard widget but doesn't manufacture a ticket. Use `severity_min: 1` + `action: ignore` as a low-priority catch-all to keep flapping Warnings entirely off the page.

---

## Manual promote

Each alert detail page carries a **Promote to ticket** button. Writes `kind='manual'` to the audit log; sets `promoted_by_user_id` + `promoted_at`.

---

## Dashboard widget

`/api/alerts?state=firing&limit=8` feeds the **Active alerts** card on the dashboard. Visible to Admin / Manager / Tech.

The widget respects the dashboard's project filter — pass `&project_id=N,M` to scope. Useful when a single user juggles multiple customer projects.

## Integration registry

Built-in adapters live in `services/integrations/registry.js`:

| Vendor | Kind | Capabilities |
|---|---|---|
| Zabbix | `webhook` + optional REST backfill | alerts |
| Action1 | `rest_poll` (OAuth2 client-credentials) | alerts + inventory + software + vulnerabilities + companies |
| `webhook` (generic) | webhook + tabular field-map editor | alerts (anything mappable) |

Each adapter declares a `credentialsSchema` — `name`, `kind`, `label`, `required` — which the registry-driven add form renders. Onboarding a new RMM with a webhook-flavored alert format is now a JSON edit, not a code change.

**Action1**-specific operational notes:

- Client-side rate limit via a per-source token bucket (`services/action1RateLimit.js`).
- 429 responses pause the source for the `Retry-After` window.
- The poll scheduler (`services/alertSourcePollScheduler.js`) interleaves sources so one slow tenant can't starve the others.

See `inventory.md` for how the same Action1 connection feeds the inventory module simultaneously.
